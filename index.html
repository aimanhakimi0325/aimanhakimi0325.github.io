    <!-- Methodology section explaining the study process and approach -->
    <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <h3>1. Study Area Definition</h3>
        <p>We focused on the University of Malaya (UM) campus, covering key areas such as academic buildings, residential halls, pathways, and open spaces. These areas were selected due to their high usage and vulnerability to flooding during heavy rainfall.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Data Collection Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <!-- Data collection techniques used for identifying flood hotspots -->
            <li><strong>Surveys and Interviews:</strong> Engaged with students, staff, and campus maintenance teams to gather firsthand accounts of flood-prone areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Field Observations:</strong> Conducted on-site inspections during and after rainfall events to record water accumulation and drainage performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Geospatial Mapping:</strong> Used GPS tools and GIS software to map low-lying areas and water flow patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Meteorological Data:</strong> Collected historical and real-time rainfall data from the Malaysian Meteorological Department to correlate flooding incidents with precipitation intensity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Data Analysis</h3>
        <ul>
            <!-- Methods used to analyze flood hotspots and their severity -->
            <li><strong>Hotspot Identification:</strong> Combined observational data with GIS mapping to pinpoint recurring flood zones.</li>
            <li><strong>Severity Assessment:</strong> Classified hotspots based on flood depth, frequency, and duration.</li>
            <li><strong>Causal Analysis:</strong> Investigated contributing factors like poor drainage, topography, or urban infrastructure issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Tools and Technologies Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <!-- Tools and technologies used to conduct research -->
            <li>GIS software for mapping and spatial analysis.</li>
            <li>Digital photography and video recording for documentation.</li>
            <li>Rain gauges and water level sensors for quantitative measurements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Validation</h3>
        <p>Our findings were cross-verified with campus maintenance records and stakeholder feedback to ensure accuracy and reliability.</p>

        <h3>6. Continuous Monitoring</h3>
        <p>This project is ongoing, with periodic updates to incorporate new data and address changing campus conditions. Users can contribute by reporting observations via the “Report a Flood” feature on this website.</p>

    <!-- Background history section about flooding at UM campus -->
    <section id="history">
        <h2>Background History</h2>
        <p>Flooding at the University of Malaya (UM) campus is a re-occurring issue due to its position in Kuala Lumpur, a city that is frequently hit by flash floods during heavy rainfall. Flood episodes on campus have impacted academic and administrative activity, including the suspension of some classes and causing difficulties for people and cars accessing the campus during these events.</p>
        <p>Unseasonably excessive rainfall, surpassing the capacity of drainage systems, and closeness to flood-prone areas are all major contributors to floods at UM. For example, torrential rainfall in October 2024 created significant interruptions, forcing students and staff to switch to online classes due to dangerous conditions.</p>
        <p>The administration monitors such activities and offers regular updates to promote safety among the university community. Flood mitigation efforts involve regular monitoring and drainage infrastructure improvements.</p>
